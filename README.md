### Descriptions of interesting features and your reflections
It was really interesting to explore the cost management and billing features on Azure. When I confirmed whether I was at the correct destination to complete the budget and alert setup portion of the assignment, I discovered that there are different methods of arriving at a webpage such as using the hamburger menu, search bar, or homepage. On the overview page for cost management and billing, it was convenient to find the features related to cost management and billing as dropdown options on the left side of the screen. Furthermore, the cost-saving recommendations provided by Azure Advisor were incredible to browse because they offered specific approaches to save on costs for so many different types of Azure services. I found it extremely helpful that the Azure Advisor cost-saving recommendations webpage was organized by category and under each category were various strategies on how to budget your spending with brief explanations and hyperlinks to webpages for further information on the process.

### Descriptions of interesting features and your reflections
Compared to Azure, it was easier to navigate through the features on GCP due to the layout of the platform. Upon arriving on the cost breakdown page, I found it useful that they provide a visual representation of your usage cost, and below the graph are hyperlinks that bring you back to the reports section to view additional details. While exploring the billing section of GCP, I discovered the FinOps hub feature. It seems to be a convenient and helpful tool for users to receive information on active recommendations and potential savings per month. On top of that, I thought it was interesting that the FinOps hub also provided a FinOps score and maturity rating for users as a reference to improve their management and practices on the platform relating to cost.
